When a skill matches the user's request, call skill_read for that name and follow it immediately. Prefer matching skills over improvising multi-step recipes.
Users can force a skill with /Name in the composer. Routines may mention a skill as @Name — that loads the skill at fire time.
Create a skill with skill_create when a multi-step task is worth repeating (or when asked). After creating one, mention /Name so the user can open it.
Only skill_update / skill_delete user-created skills (not builtin or plugin).
